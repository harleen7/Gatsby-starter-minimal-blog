This blog is made using Gatsby static site generator and hosted on Netlify. The idea is to pour down some of the good finds and ideas on this blog so they don't get forgotten and can be useful to someone else someday.

NGL, hosting and publishing it on Netlify wasn't easy. Even though the documentation is great, I managed to run into unexpected puny yet time-consuming road-bumps at almost every step of setting it up. I was suggested by my well-wishing friends to just host it on Wordpress, but I also wanted to host a local-serp generator tool on the same domain or perhaps some other custom stuff in the future. The cutomizability on Netlify and being able to host from a Github repo is what made Netlify worth it.

It's definitely an upgrade from the [Blogspot blog.](http://tickettonothing.blogspot.com/)


Thank you for reading. Come back soon!
